## Memorandum

This is a school project started as a means of learning to use Java and the Swing graphics library over the course of a year. As a project done for educational purposes, the initial code quality will be poor, development will be slow, and whether development will be pushed beyond the initial one year timeframe is largely tentative. For the same reason, if you're not a collaborator, please refrain from contributing until the end of the specified timeframe (June 2023). Issues are OK.

## To-Do

- [x] Title Interface
- [x] Settings Interface
- [ ] Character Naming Interface (chippy please submit the PR already)
- [ ] Paused Interface
- [ ] The Actual GameTM

## Building

Builds are usually [published](https://github.com/twofacedflora/Down-The-Plumeria-Lane/releases) with every commit. If you'd like to compile the project yourself, try the following steps:

1. Ensure you have _at least_ JDK 8 installed. You can download the latest release from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Alternative JDKs such as [Liberica](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/) should work fine.
2. [Download](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repository.
3. Open the project folder in a terminal and run `./build.sh`.

### Troubleshooting
