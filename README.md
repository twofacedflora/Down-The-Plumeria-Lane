<center>A small experimental RPG project.</center>

## Memorandum

This is a school project started as a means of learning to use Java and the Swing graphics library over the course of a year. As a project done for educational purposes, the initial code quality will be poor, development will be slow, and whether development will be pushed beyond the initial one year timeframe is largely tentative. For the same reason, if you're not a collaborator, please refrain from contributing until the end of the specified timeframe (June 2023). Issues are OK.

## To-Do

- [x] Title Interface
- [x] Settings Interface
- [ ] Character Naming Interface (chippy i'm at my wit's end please make that PR already)
- [ ] Paused Interface
- [ ] The Actual GameTM (you haven't even started the actual game? the hell dude)

## Building

Builds are usually published with every commit. If you'd like to compile the project yourself, try the following steps:

1. Ensure you have _at least_ JDK 8 installed. You can download the latest release from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). Alternative JDKs such as [Liberica](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/) should work fine.
2. [Download the repository](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
3. Open the project folder in a terminal and run `./build.sh`.

### Troubleshooting

**Permission Denied (macOS/Linux only)**

The script isn't executable. Run `chmod +x build.sh`.

**Didn't help?**
